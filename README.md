# JointSavings_SmartContract
This is the automation of joint savings accounts's setup. It is a solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint savings account.


## Technologies
We will using Remix IDE open source web application to compile, deploy and test our Smart Contract.
