# JointSavings_SmartContract

In this repo we will automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you will create a solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint savings account.


## Technologies
We will using Remix IDE open source web application to compile, deploy and test our Smart Contract. 

* <https://remix.ethereum.org/>


 
## Usage

* Clone the repository.

* Open it in Remix IDE

For demonstration purposes we use JavaScript VM sandbox to deploy aor SmartContract and 2 Ethereum dummy addresses from Vanity-Eth vanity address generator.

See the video below how it works
