/*
Joint Savings Account
---------------------

Automation of the creation of joint savings accounts. 
A solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. 
The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint savings account.

---------------------
We will use the following Ethereum dummy addresses on the Vanity-ETH website, which includes an Ethereum vanity address generator.

  Dummy account1 address: 0x0c0669Cd5e60a6F4b8ce437E4a4A007093D368Cb
  Dummy account2 address: 0x7A1f3dFAa0a4a19844B606CD6e91d693083B12c0
